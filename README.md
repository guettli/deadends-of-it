# Deadends of Information Technology

I was born 1976, learned programming 1989, studied information technology 1996-2001 and worked since then in this business.

I am 43 years old now. I have seen a lot of hypes coming and going.

Here is list of things I have seen going. Some former hypes, some things that never started.

GUI development: gtk and qt: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[gtk,qt]

## Network File Systems

NFS (Network File System). Application servers use storage servers using simple protocols like s3 to store and retrieve blobs.
And users prefer the speed of very fast local ssd disks. Software gets stored in git. Many documents get edited only, and the few bytes 
that get stored in your personal $HOME directory get synced with DropBox, Nextcloud or GoogleDrive.

Same for WebDAV.

# API Data Exchange

Corba was a big hype some years ago. AFAIK it does not get used for new projects any more.

Stateless APIs have won.

Corba gave you references to remote objects. Sounds great at the beginning. But stateless APIs (via http) are simpler. 
And simpler is better than "wow".

From Wikipedia: SOAP (abbreviation for Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to provide extensibility, neutrality and independence. It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.

Me: It is too complicated. It is overengineered. The client for python was not updated since months. Dead.

# Data formats

XML was a very big hype. Again: Way too complicated. Not simple enough. JSON (current hype) is much better to exchange data, since it supports some simple data types (int, string, list, dictionaries)

# Applications

Emacs: I used this text editor 14 years daily (2001-2015). I switched to PyCharm. http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[emacs,pycharm]

zsh: Alternative to the bash shell (linux command line langauge). I was very interested at the beginning. But finally, you do not gain much. The bash is the default shell, and for me it does not make much sense to use a different shell. http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[zsh,bash]

# Hardware

Ubuntu-Phone. Don't ask me why Mark Shuttleworth ever thought this will be a success. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Touch
