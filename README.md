# Deadends of Information Technology

I was born 1976, learned programming 1989, studied information technology 1996-2001 and worked since then in this business.

I am 43 years old now. I have seen a lot of hypes coming and going.

Here is list of things I have seen going. Some former hypes, some things that never started.

## Network File Systems

NFS (Network File System). Application servers use storage servers using simple protocols like s3 to store and retrieve blobs.
And users prefer the speed of very fast local ssd disks. Software gets stored in git. Many documents get edited only, and the few bytes 
that get stored in your personal $HOME directory get synced with DropBox, Nextcloud or GoogleDrive.

Same for WebDAV.

# API Data Exchange

Corba was a big hype some years ago. AFAIK it does not get used for new projects any more.

Stateless APIs have won.

Corba gave you references to remote objects. Sounds great at the beginning. But stateless APIs (via http) are simpler. 
And simpler is better than "wow".

# Applications

Emacs: I used this text editor 14 years daily (2001-2015). I switched to PyCharm. http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[emacs,pycharm]
