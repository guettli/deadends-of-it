# Deadends of Information Technology

I was borgn 1976, learned programming 1989, studied information technology 1996-2001 and worked since then in this business.

I have seen a lot of hypes coming and going.

Here is list of things I have seen going. Some former hypes, some things that never started.

NFS (Network File System). Application servers use storage servers using simple protocols like s3 to store and retrieve blobs.
And users prefer the speed of very fast local ssd disks. Software gets stored in git. Many documents get edited only, and the few bytes 
that get stored in your personal $HOME directory get synced with DropBox, Nextcloud or GoogleDrive.

Same for WebDAV.
