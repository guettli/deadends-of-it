# Deadends of Information Technology

I was born 1976, learned programming 1989, studied information technology 1996-2001 and worked since then in this business.

I am 43 years old now. I have seen a lot of hypes coming and going.

Here is list of things I have seen going. Some former hypes, some things that never started. 

"All we are is dust in the wind" (Songwriter: Kerry Livgren)

GUI development: gtk and qt: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[gtk,qt]

## Network File Systems

NFS (Network File System). Application servers use storage servers using simple protocols like s3 to store and retrieve blobs.
And users prefer the speed of very fast local ssd disks. Software gets stored in git. Many documents get edited only, and the few bytes 
that get stored in your personal $HOME directory get synced with DropBox, Nextcloud or GoogleDrive.

Same for WebDAV.

Owncloud (ownCloud is a suite of clientâ€“server software for creating and using file hosting services. ownCloud functionally has similarities to the widely used Dropbox) was great some months ago. I switched to nextcloud like most other users:

# API Data Exchange

Corba was a big hype some years ago. AFAIK it does not get used for new projects any more.

Stateless APIs have won.

Corba gave you references to remote objects. Sounds great at the beginning. But stateless APIs (via http) are simpler. 
And simpler is better than "wow".

From Wikipedia: SOAP (abbreviation for Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to provide extensibility, neutrality and independence. It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.

Me: It is too complicated. It is overengineered. The client for python was not updated since months. Dead.

# Data formats

XML was a very big hype. Again: Way too complicated. Not simple enough. JSON (current hype) is much better to exchange data, since it supports some simple data types (int, string, list, dictionaries)

# Applications

Emacs: I used this text editor 14 years daily (2001-2015). I switched to PyCharm. http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[emacs,pycharm]

zsh: Alternative to the bash shell (linux command line langauge). I was very interested at the beginning. But finally, you do not gain much. The bash is the default shell, and for me it does not make much sense to use a different shell. http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[zsh,bash]

Alternative to the (source code) version-control system git. Git has won. Alternatives do not make sense any more. http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[git,mercurial,bazaar,svn]

OpenStack: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[openstack]

Desktop office: MS-Office, Libreoffice. These programms were very important in the past. Today most people learned, that you can write the text directly into the mail body. You do not need to add a ms-word document to the mail.

# Programming languages

Low-level languages like assembly, C, C++ are the building blocks of higher level languages. But the usage of these languages is in decline or constant low. Here in comparison with Python: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[assembly,c,c%2B%2B,python]

Java was a big hype and is still wide spread. It is no "deadend" yet, but declinging: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[python,java]

# Linux on the desktop.

Some overambitious friends of open source software and open data formats thought you need to switch from Microsoft Windows to Linux as soon as possible. Like the LiMux Project in the year 2005:

> LiMux was a project by the city of Munich in Germany to migrate local government software systems from closed-source, proprietary Microsoft products to free and open-source software. The project ran from 2005 to 2013, migrating over 18,000 personal computers and laptops of public employees to a Linux-based software solution.

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiMux

I think they did a major mistake: It would have been much simpler, and more successfull, if they would have done several small steps, instead of one big step. First step for me would be to switch from closed source to open source application, but stay on MS-Windows operating system. The LiMux project wanted too much too soon (Linux on the desktop). The LiMux project failed.

# Hardware

Ubuntu-Phone. Don't ask me why Mark Shuttleworth ever thought this will be a success. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Touch

# Configuration Management

Chef and Puppet (the older ones) and Ansible and Salt where the new ones. In 2013 it was not clear who will win the race. Today in 2019 it is clear. Ansible has won: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[salt-stack,ansible,chef,puppet]
