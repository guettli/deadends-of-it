# Deadends of Information Technology

I was born 1976, learned programming 1989, studied information technology 1996-2001 and worked since then in this business.

I am 43 years old now. I have seen a lot of hypes coming and going.

Here is list of things I have seen going. Some former hypes, some things that never started. 

"All we are is dust in the wind" (Songwriter: Kerry Livgren)

## Native GUI development

GUI development: gtk and qt: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[gtk,qt]

## Network File Systems

NFS (Network File System). Today people either use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block to access files on a network share, or they use a web based file service (DropBox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Nextcloud, ...)

Today application servers talk to storage servers using simple protocols like s3 to store and retrieve blobs, not NFS.


Same for WebDAV. 
http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[nfs,webdav]

## OwnCloud
Owncloud (ownCloud is a suite of clientâ€“server software for creating and using file hosting services. ownCloud functionally has similarities to the widely used Dropbox) was great some months ago. I switched to nextcloud like most other users:

# API and Data Exchange

## Corba

[Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture) was a big hype some years ago. In 2001 I thought this is the future. AFAIK it does not get used for new projects any more.

Stateless APIs have won.

Corba gave you references to remote objects. Sounds great at the beginning. But stateless APIs (via http) are simpler. 
And simpler is better than "wow".

http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[corba,protocol-buffers]

## SOAP

From Wikipedia: SOAP (abbreviation for Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to provide extensibility, neutrality and independence. It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP

Me: It is too complicated. It is overengineered. The client for python was not updated since months. Dead.

XML-RPC was nice, too. Simpler than soap. But same here: dead.

http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[soap,xml-rpc]

# Data formats

XML was a very big hype. Again: Way too complicated. Not simple enough. JSON (current hype) is much better to exchange data, since it supports some simple data types (int, string, list, dictionaries)

http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[xml,json]

BUT: Binary data, native time format, timedelta and other things are missing. I think protcol-buffers would be great for exchanging data between systems, but up to now only few people think like this.

# Applications

Emacs: I used this text editor 14 years daily (2001-2015). I switched to PyCharm. http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[emacs,pycharm]

zsh: Alternative to the bash shell (linux command line language). I was very interested at the beginning. But finally, you do not gain much. The bash is the default shell, and for me it does not make much sense to use a different shell. http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[zsh,bash]

Alternative to the (source code) version-control system git. Git has won. Alternatives do not make sense any more. http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[git,mercurial,bazaar,svn]


Desktop office: MS-Office, Libreoffice. These programms were very important in the past. Today most people learned, that you can write the text directly into the mail body. You do not need to add a ms-word document to the mail. 
http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[ms-office,libreoffice]

KDE "The K desktop environment" was very wide spread (at least in germany) for some years. But gnome has not much more traffic: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[kde,gnome]

Nagios was once the number 1 monitoring solution. Time has changed. I guess most people would not start to use it today, if they could start from scratch. Here Nagios compared with Zabbix, PRTG, check_mk: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=nagios,%2Fm%2F03c9jx,%2Fg%2F11bc5wdh4r,%2Fm%2F0h_9jxz

# Cloud computing / Virtualization

[OpenStack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack): http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[openstack] I read the german Linux Magazine monthly. At first I was very exited about this project. More than 500 companies have joined the project .... [Companies Supporting The OpenStack Foundation](https://www.openstack.org/foundation/companies/) Lesson learned: The bigger the project, the slower the progress.

[XEN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xen) (Linux Hypervisor). XEN compared with VMWare and Kubernetes: https://trends.google.de/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F02t3gg,%2Fm%2F01t9k5,%2Fg%2F11b7lxp79d


# Programming languages

Low-level languages like assembly, C, C++ are the building blocks of higher level languages. But the usage of these languages is in decline or constant low. Here in comparison with Python: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[assembly,c,c%2B%2B,python]

Java was a big hype and is still wide spread. It is no "deadend" yet, but declining: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[python,java] In 2003 I was seaking a new job in a new city (Chemnitz). Most jobs for software developers where for Java or C/C++ developers. But I found a company where I can use Python daily ([tbz-pariv](http://www.tbz-pariv.de/))

I just don't know if XSLT is a programming language or a data format. I never liked it. It was way too verbose, it was complicated to write. It was not a real programming language and simple things got complicated soon.
I am happy to see XSLT going: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[xslt]

Perl vs Python: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[perl,python]

C# vs Ruby vs Python: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[c%23,python,ruby]

Shell Scripts: https://trends.google.de/trends/explore?date=all&q=shell%20scripts (I use the shell interatively daily. But I stopped
writing shell scripts several years ago. Either the script is important (then it I do it with Python and store it in git) xor it is unimportant.

# Regular Expressions

Parsing text with regular expressions is like eating rubish. In the 21 century we send an receive data structures. We don't send strings which the receiver needs to parse.

https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=32&date=all&q=regular%20expressions,json


# Linux on the desktop.

Some overambitious friends of open source software and open data formats thought you need to switch from Microsoft Windows to Linux as soon as possible. Like the LiMux Project in the year 2005:

> LiMux was a project by the city of Munich in Germany to migrate local government software systems from closed-source, proprietary Microsoft products to free and open-source software. The project ran from 2005 to 2013, migrating over 18,000 personal computers and laptops of public employees to a Linux-based software solution.

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiMux

I think they did a major mistake: It would have been much simpler, and more successfull, if they would have done several small steps, instead of one big step. First step for me would be to switch from closed source to open source application, but stay on MS-Windows operating system. The LiMux project wanted too much too soon (Linux on the desktop). The LiMux project failed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiMux

Today, every desktop usage is decreasing. Mobile interfaces get used.

# Hardware

Ubuntu-Phone. Don't ask me why Mark Shuttleworth ever thought this will be a success. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Touch

# Configuration Management

Chef and Puppet (the older ones) and Ansible and Salt where the new ones. In 2013 it was not clear who will win the race. Today in 2019 it is clear. Ansible has won: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[salt-stack,ansible,chef,puppet]

# Backup

Of course making backup of data is still done often and makes sense. But it gets done less often.

mobile devices: My wife, my son and I, we do not backup our mobile phones. I guess most people do it like this. The device does not store important data that is not stored somewhere else. The device contains contacts, calendars, some documents shared via nextcloud. Mails are stored on the mail server. 

Of course it will be very annoying if the mobile device would get lost or broken. It will be a lot of work to configure the new device. But no important data would get lost.

At work I do no backup of linux laptop. Software I write gets pushed to a central git server every day.

See the trend: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[backup]

# Perfect Filesystems

Several times the perfect Linux filesystem was invented: ext2, ext3, reiserfs, zfs, btrfs .... 

Today the discussions about which file system is the best have mostly vanished.

I could not find a reliable reference, but AFAIK google used ext2 for their servers very long (If you find a reliable reference, please tell me). To make it short: It does not matter. If you want high availablity, then be sure that your service survives the outage of servers. A reliable file system does not make your whole service reliable.

Modern applications use storage services.

# Mailing lists

I the past I used mailing lists a lot. But today I use StackOverflow and other sites from StackExchange. Github issues get used to ask questions, too. And a few google groups. I am only subscribed to a few mailing lists today.

I like this change. This buries the never ending discussion if the reply on a mailing-list should go to the list or to the author of the mail. 

# Markup Languages

I think markup languages have lost - except html. Once upon a time Markup languages like  reStructuredText were used to create documentation
which can be compiled to HTML or PDF. Who prints docs today? I don't know anybody who prints docs today.

HTML is the future. There are easy to use HTML online editors like CKEditor. 

HTML gives two distinct groups of people all that they want. Geeks can write HTML directly and use all feature it offers. And CKEditor gives non-geeks a way to create formated text.

Markup languages are on the downward trend.

Most of them go down. Markdown still goes a bit up: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[sphinx,restructuredtext,markdown,mediawiki]

Same for Latex. The need for printable documentation is falling. In 2001 I used Latex for my diploma thesis. This was a good choice since MS-Word and OpenOffice were not reliable these days. Today, I think I would not use Latex again.

# Inotify

Inotify is a nice feature of the linux kernel. You can listen for changes in directories. If there is a change (for example a new file), then
you get an event and you can execute some custom code (for example process the new file).

I once thought inotify is great. 

Time has changed.

Now I know: the file system is not an API.

Use Case: a third party service sends you pairs of files. One image file and one json file. The json file contains meta information. If you receive the files via SMB/NFS/FTP and trigger the handling of these files via inotify, then you can't reject broken data. Imagine you get only the json file, but not the image file. Now you (the receiver) need to handle this broken data. If you use http, you can reject broken data and the issue is left to the sending party. And that's where the issue should be. The receiver can't fix broken data. It the job of the sender to transfer valid data.

Of course above use case applies if you don't use inotify. You could use a cron-job which imports the files every five minutes.

Today I prefer http.

Shameless plug: You can use [tbzuploader](https://github.com/tbz-pariv/tbzuploader) to upload single or pairs of files via http.

# Mail admin - a declining job

Decision-makers prefer to pay for service offered by big well-known giants. They do not like to pay a human which does the job.

This google trend chars shows it: Microsoft-Exchange (mail server for windows) and Postfix (mail server for linux) are in decline. Configuring mail servers is not easy. Especially handling spam is daily work and annoyance. If you are young and you are unsure what you want to do in the future? Do not consider to get a mail admin. This job is in decline:

https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F02js54,%2Fm%2F04nh2c

People do use native GUI mail user agents (like for example thunderbird) less often. They use the web interface of big mail providers more.

Maybe this trend is good. I had to explain the difference between an envelope-from to the body-from already several times to people who were responsible for a mail server. This difference seems to be too much for the average windows admin. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_address

But today handling mail is more than managing a smtp and imap server. For most users mail, spam filtering, calendar, contacts, sending and accepting invitations via mail, cloud storage and ... all is one thing.

Who influences the future of (mail) admins? The people how pay them. And most decision makers prefer to pay for a service which has a reliable support even on weekends. The admin wants a weekend and he wants holiday and sometimes he is ill. Be honest with yourself: If you would be the decision-maker, it is sad but true, you would choose the service, not the human.

And that's why I think in the future there will be less (mail) admins. Companies with less then 200 accounts will buy a service. Only big companies will run their own infrastructure. 

Of course there needs to someone for the hardware. But the server hardware will leave the small companies, moving to big companies providing cheap software as a service. No need to care for backup, too. Doesn't this feel like flying?


Sooner or later automation will eat all jobs.

# microkernel

In the year 2000 when I was a student (HTW Dresden) I was very curious about
micro kernels. At TU-Dresden there were projects working on a micro kernel based
operating system. I loved to talk with people involved in the micro kernel projects.
But I found no answer to the question "why?" which convinced me. In the year 2000
I thought to myself "I don't get why a microkernel should be better than a modular
kernel like linux".

Now, in the year 2019 I think there are no real arguments pro microkernel. Nice theory, but performance is much more important. Practical real world applications use several operating systems today. Fault tolerance gets handled at a different level today.

But there are micro kernel based operating systems like: https://genode.org/

# RAW image format

When I bought my first reflex camera (Canon 50D) most friends which already had a reflex camera told me that is great because you can make photos in the raw image format. This raw format contains much more information and this is much, much better for post-processing.

I still like my reflex camera (it is ten years old now), but I never liked the raw format. Yes, the post-processing possiblities are great. But the size is major drawback. And the time you need to do the post-processing.

I asked some of my friends some days ago again. None of them still use the raw image format by default today. They all use jpeg. It is simpler, more convenient.

Of course there are professional photographers who use the raw format daily. That's not what I talk about. I look at the everday use case of an average human who likes to take pictures.

# DRBD

> DRBD is a distributed replicated storage system for the Linux platform. It is implemented as a kernel driver, several userspace management applications, and some shell scripts. DRBD is traditionally used in high availability (HA) computer clusters, but beginning with DRBD version 9, it can also be used to create larger software defined storage pools with a focus on cloud integration.

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Replicated_Block_Device

DRBD is not dead, but it does decline.

The High availability method "One master, N secondary slaves" with failover was popular in the past.

Today High availablity get's handled different.


The trends show how it does decline. Here in comparison with [Ceph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceph_%28software%29): https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F0b1yt5,ceph


# Web Developement 

Java Applets running in the web browser are dead: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=java%20applets

Same for Adobe Flash Player: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F05qh6g

In the year 2001, when I finished my study, I never thought the trend will be like this. In the beginning, the language JavaScript was not taken seriously. Today JavaScript is even running on the server.

Up to now (2019) I still use jQuery. But I was told by several JavaScript developers, that if you start from scratch today, you don't need jquery and more. The tag trend is clear: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[jquery]


# Jenkins

It is still actively used. But the future looks black - gitlab is comming: http://sotagtrends.com/?tags=[jenkins,gitlab]

# Portability

In a world of containers and SaaS you don't need portability any more. You create software which takes a vanilla linux distribution container image. Then you modify this according to your needs. There is no need to support several operating systems. If your application wants to use database FooDB (in my case PostgreSQL), then use all features FooDB supports. Often (not always) you don't need to support several different databases.

Of course this does not apply to all software. General purpose things like compilers (gcc), interpreters (Python), databases (PostgreSQL), IDE (PyCharm), web-browsers ... still need to be portable. But only few developers spent their time building these fundamental building blocks.

"Portable shell scripts?" ... HELP! Don't waste your time writing portable shell scripts.

Portability across different browsers? The situations can't be compared to the past. Today you use a library like jquery, React or Angular and only rough edge cases are not portable.

Look at all the confusion and useless work that was created by thinking writing a bash script is evil. The term "Bashism" was created and over commited people started to make things more complicated instead of more easy. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh Depending on my mood this makes me laugh or sometimes cry. The DashAsBinSh page contains so many things to consider. But according to my point of view the most important thing is missing. The "why?" is missing. I see no real reason, no measurable benefit. If you want to use the bash use "#!/bin/bash" at the top and make the rpm/dpkg depend on the bash. If you want to use super-fast-shell, then use "#!/bin/super-fast-shell" at the top and make the rpm/dpkg depend on the super-fast-shell. Why try to write a script which runs with bash and super-fast-shell? Compare this to python/perl: Have you ever considered to write a script which can be executed by the perl and by the python interpreter :-) ?

# Epilogue

You use some tools or methods which are dated? You would never ever do this again if you could start from scratch, but you need to support this old stuff because it is your job? 

Me too.

You can't change the world in one day.

But I think it is healthy to reflect upon the things you did in the past and discuss the conclusion with others.
